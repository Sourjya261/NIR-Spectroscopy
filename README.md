# NIR-Spectroscopy
This presentation explains the concept of using NIR Spectroscopy to non-invasively estimate the concentration of substances in biological specimens

Actually, this project is rather unstructured. Actually, I don't have any code to display here. My father was hospitalised after being diagnosed with COVID 19 during the lockdown in June. The drugs they gave him back then caused his blood sugar levels to be extremely erratic. His blood sugar was checked around 20 times a day, and each poke was excruciatingly painful. I had then began looking into the possibility of a non-invasive blood glucometer. The most likely candidate looked to be NIR spectroscopy. With a crude spectroscope, I first tried to gauge the chlorophyll content of plants. An outdated camera that had been disassembled and a DVD's diffraction grating were used to construct the spectroscope. An old webcam that had been disassembled was used to construct the spectroscope, and a DVD's diffraction grating was mounted on its lens. An unfinished wooden box with metal slots contained the assembly. The Theremino Spectrum Analyzer was used to examine the absorption spectrum of different leaves using a known source of white light. Comparing the chlorophyll concentrations in various leaves was done using a modified version of Beer-law. Given the opportunity and resources I might actually one day like to extend this concept to blood sugar detection.
